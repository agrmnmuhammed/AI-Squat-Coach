##  Description
A real-time squat analysis system using **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV**.  
The system detects human body landmarks, calculates knee angles, counts squat repetitions, and provides instant **coaching feedback** such as:  
- ✅ Correct squat depth  
- ⚠️ Too deep / Not deep enough  
- ⚠️ Keep your back straight  
- 👍 Ready for the next rep  

This project turns your **webcam** into a personal AI coach.
